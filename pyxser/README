pxyser --- python xml serialization

pyxser stands for Python XML Serialization, it's Python
object serializer that does the job in a standard way.
Unlike other serializers, it uses structured document
defined in the pyxser DTD, has a FPI (public format
identifier) and the deserialization process run before
validating the serialized object document against the
pyxser DTD.

A sample of a serialized object is the XML as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<pyxs:obj xmlns:pyxs="http://projects.coder.cl/pyxser/model/"
          version="1.0"
          type="TestAnotherObject"
          module="testpkg.sample"
          id="id-136688140">
  <pyxs:prop type="str" name="first_element">456</pyxs:prop>
  <pyxs:prop type="str" name="second_element">789</pyxs:prop>
</pyxs:obj>


pyxser supports cross referenced objects and nested referenced
object, because it defines the a ref attribute as IDREF which
is used to link internal nodes in the document tree.
