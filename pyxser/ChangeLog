0.2rc1 (2009.04.08):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added serialize_c14n()
	* Added serialize_c14n_strict()
	* Added validate_c14n()
	* Added encodings support
	* Added serialization depth support


0.2r (2009.04.18):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Removed memory leaks concerning libxml2 usage.
	* Removed memory leaks concerning Python C/API usage.
	* Improved fault detection.
	* Improved pointer checking deallocations.
	* Added unit test test-utf8-prof.py with 50.000 cilces ;)
	* Every serilization is made into unicode objects.


1.0rc1 (2009.04.26):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added both byte string and unicode returning and procesing
	functions. This means that we have serialize(),
	serialize_c14n(), serialize_c14n_strict(), unserialize(),
	validate() and validate_c14n() functions for byte strings
	and u_serialize(), u_serialize_c14n(), u_serialize_c14n_strict(),
	u_unserialize(), u_validate() and u_validate_c14n() for
	unicode strings.
	* Removed memory leaks, now it runs over 1400000 pyxser
	operations without crashing (100000 cicles testing every
	function).
	* Removed bugs concerning reference counting that was
	crashing when trying to access unserialized objects attributes.
	* This is an approach to a production environment release ;)
