0.2rc1 (2009.04.08):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added serialize_c14n()
	* Added serialize_c14n_strict()
	* Added validate_c14n()
	* Added encodings support
	* Added serialization depth support


0.2r (2009.04.18):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Removed memory leaks concerning libxml2 usage.
	* Removed memory leaks concerning Python C/API usage.
	* Improved fault detection.
	* Improved pointer checking deallocations.
	* Added unit test test-utf8-prof.py with 50.000 cilces ;)
	* Every serilization is made into unicode objects.


1.0rc1 (2009.04.26):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added both byte string and unicode returning and procesing
	functions. This means that we have serialize(),
	serialize_c14n(), serialize_c14n_strict(), unserialize(),
	validate() and validate_c14n() functions for byte strings
	and u_serialize(), u_serialize_c14n(), u_serialize_c14n_strict(),
	u_unserialize(), u_validate() and u_validate_c14n() for
	unicode strings.
	* Removed memory leaks, now it runs over 1400000 pyxser
	operations without crashing (100000 cicles testing every
	function).
	* Removed bugs concerning reference counting that was
	crashing when trying to access unserialized objects attributes.
	* This is an approach to a production environment release ;)

1.0r (2009.05.09):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Set default validation to XML Schema validation, to allow
	pyxser to work with WebServices and similar technologies,
	without restricting the namespace prefix to pyxs.
	* Removed memory leaks concerning XML Schema validation.
	* Succeful tests with more than 1.200.000 pyxser operations.
	* Added pyxser 1.0 XML Schema to allow imports of the pyxser
	model into WebServices WSDL and similar technologies.
	* Addded getxsd(), getxsd_c14n(), u_validate_c14n_dtd(),
	u_validate_dtd(), validate_c14n_dtd(), validate_dtd()
	functions.
	* All *_dtd() related functions allows you to validate
	pyxser documents using the pyxser 1.0 DTD, instead of
	the pyxser 1.0 XML Schema.

1.1r (2009.05.09):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Removed bugs concerning XML schema declaration for output
	documents.
	* Removed bugs concerning XML schema design for C14N
	serialization.
	* Removed exc argument from C14N serialization functions,
	because they have no sense.
	* Code cleanup with function arguments (C code).
	* All changes seems to be transparent for previous versions.

1.2r (2009.08.23):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added encoded serialization of Unicode strings by using
	the user defined encoding as is passed to the serialization
	functions as enc parameter
	* Refactored some functions to allow more ordered code.

1.3r (2009.11.30):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* pyxser_tools.c: Removed bug concerning deserialization of
	collection elements; pyxser now can handle extension declared
	classes, such as boost::python ones --- thanks to the
	suggestions made by Daniel Filonik.
	* pyxser.c: Added /selector/ as optional argument used as
	callback to select object attributes to being serialized.
	* pyxser_string.c: Removed bug concerning unicode serialization.

	Thanks pyxser users for your feedback...

1.4r (2009.12.26):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* pyxser_typem.c: Added type map serialization and deserialization
	routines and arguments. Now pyxser is able to serialize and
	deserialize objects using custom serialization functions, but
	preserving the pyxser XML schema and the serialization model.

1.4.2r (2010.02.10):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* pyxser_collections.c: Added constraint checks for NULL
	pointers removing nested statements.
	* pyxser.c: Removed nested statements.
	* pyxser_tools.c: Added constratints checks for NULL pointers,
	removed nested statements and added strict checking for lists
	since it was crashing with an ambigous list definition that
	can not be handled by PyList_Check().
	* test-utf8.py: Added tests to determine if it continue
	crashing with module serialization.

	Thanks to pyxser users for their feedback.
