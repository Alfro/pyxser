0.2rc1 (2009.04.08):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added serialize_c14n()
	* Added serialize_c14n_strict()
	* Added validate_c14n()
	* Added encodings support
	* Added serialization depth support


0.2r (2009.04.18):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Removed memory leaks concerning libxml2 usage.
	* Removed memory leaks concerning Python C/API usage.
	* Improved fault detection.
	* Improved pointer checking deallocations.
	* Added unit test test-utf8-prof.py with 50.000 cilces ;)
	* Every serilization is made into unicode objects.


1.0rc1 (2009.04.26):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added both byte string and unicode returning and procesing
	functions. This means that we have serialize(),
	serialize_c14n(), serialize_c14n_strict(), unserialize(),
	validate() and validate_c14n() functions for byte strings
	and u_serialize(), u_serialize_c14n(), u_serialize_c14n_strict(),
	u_unserialize(), u_validate() and u_validate_c14n() for
	unicode strings.
	* Removed memory leaks, now it runs over 1400000 pyxser
	operations without crashing (100000 cicles testing every
	function).
	* Removed bugs concerning reference counting that was
	crashing when trying to access unserialized objects attributes.
	* This is an approach to a production environment release ;)

1.0r (2009.05.09):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Set default validation to XML Schema validation, to allow
	pyxser to work with WebServices and similar technologies,
	without restricting the namespace prefix to pyxs.
	* Removed memory leaks concerning XML Schema validation.
	* Succeful tests with more than 1.200.000 pyxser operations.
	* Added pyxser 1.0 XML Schema to allow imports of the pyxser
	model into WebServices WSDL and similar technologies.
	* Addded getxsd(), getxsd_c14n(), u_validate_c14n_dtd(),
	u_validate_dtd(), validate_c14n_dtd(), validate_dtd()
	functions.
	* All *_dtd() related functions allows you to validate
	pyxser documents using the pyxser 1.0 DTD, instead of
	the pyxser 1.0 XML Schema.

1.1r (2009.05.09):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Removed bugs concerning XML schema declaration for output
	documents.
	* Removed bugs concerning XML schema design for C14N
	serialization.
	* Removed exc argument from C14N serialization functions,
	because they have no sense.
	* Code cleanup with function arguments (C code).
	* All changes seems to be transparent for previous versions.

1.2r (2009.08.23):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* Added encoded serialization of Unicode strings by using
	the user defined encoding as is passed to the serialization
	functions as enc parameter
	* Refactored some functions to allow more ordered code.

1.3r (2009.11.30):

	Daniel Molina Wegener <dmw@coder.cl>
	* pyxser_tools.c: Removed bug concerning deserialization of
	collection elements; pyxser now can handle extension declared
	classes, such as boost::python ones --- thanks to the
	suggestions made by Daniel Filonik.
	* pyxser.c: Added /selector/ as optional argument used as
	callback to select object attributes to being serialized.
	* pyxser_string.c: Removed bug concerning unicode serialization.

	Thanks pyxser users for your feedback...
